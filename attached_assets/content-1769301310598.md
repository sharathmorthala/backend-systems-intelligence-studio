# Backend Systems Intelligence Studio

Backend Systems Intelligence Studio is an interactive engineering portfolio that demonstrates how complex backend systems are analyzed, debugged, and improved in real-world environments.

It helps backend engineers, platform teams, and system designers explore how logs, APIs, code, dependencies, and system designs can be evaluated for reliability, scalability, and risk—using deterministic analysis first, with AI used strictly as an assistive layer.

This studio was built to showcase how I think as an engineer: structured problem analysis, production-minded decision making, and responsible AI integration—beyond what a résumé can show.

[Log & Incident Analyzer\\
\\
Analyze application logs and stack traces. Groups similar errors, identifies root causes, and suggests investigation steps.](https://ai-backend-tools.replit.app/tools/log-analyzer) [API Contract Reviewer\\
\\
Review REST request/response JSON and OpenAPI specs. Identifies missing fields, inconsistent error models, and breaking changes.](https://ai-backend-tools.replit.app/tools/api-reviewer) [Resilience Strategy Advisor\\
\\
Get recommendations for retry strategies, idempotency, circuit breakers, and handling partial failures.](https://ai-backend-tools.replit.app/tools/resilience-advisor) [Backend Code Risk Scanner\\
\\
Scan Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, and Python code for runtime error risks, blocking calls, thread-safety issues, and error-handling gaps.](https://ai-backend-tools.replit.app/tools/code-scanner) [System Design Reviewer\\
\\
Review system design descriptions for bottlenecks, single points of failure, scalability concerns, and observability gaps.](https://ai-backend-tools.replit.app/tools/system-reviewer) [Dependency Risk Analyzer\\
\\
Analyze dependency manifests (pom.xml, package.json, build.gradle) for vulnerabilities, unsafe versions, and supply-chain risks.](https://ai-backend-tools.replit.app/tools/dependency-analyzer)

LLMs are used as assistants. Deterministic backend logic remains the source of truth.
