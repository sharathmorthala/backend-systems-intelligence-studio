You are extending an existing application called Backend Systems Intelligence Studio.

Add a new tool to the toolkit.

Tool Name

Dependency Risk & Vulnerability Analyzer

Purpose

This tool analyzes dependency manifest files to identify:

Known vulnerability indicators

Outdated or risky dependencies

Unsafe version ranges

Supply-chain risk patterns

The goal is to surface risk signals, not to replace enterprise security scanners.

Supported Inputs

The tool must accept raw text input for:

pom.xml

build.gradle / settings.gradle

package.json

The user pastes the file contents into a text area.

Functional Behavior
Step 1: Deterministic Parsing

Implement backend logic to:

Detect dependency names and versions

Identify version ranges (e.g. +, latest, ^, x)

Flag missing lock files or version pinning

This logic must work without AI.

Step 2: Risk Classification

Classify findings into:

High Risk (known historically vulnerable libraries, unpinned versions)

Moderate Risk (outdated major versions, deprecated libraries)

Low Risk / Advisory

Step 3: AI-Assisted Explanation

Use an LLM only as an assistant to:

Explain why a dependency is risky

Provide upgrade or mitigation guidance

Identify supply-chain patterns (transitive risk, stale dependencies)

AI output must:

Be structured

Be explainable

Never be the source of truth

Output Structure

The tool must return three distinct sections:

1. Detected Risks

Bullet list of issues with severity labels.

2. Dependency Breakdown

Per-dependency analysis:

Name

Version

Risk level

Reason

3. Recommendations

Actionable steps:

Upgrade suggestions

Version pinning

CI/CD integration guidance

Failure & Fallback Behavior

If AI is unavailable:

Still return deterministic risk findings

Display a message:

“AI insights unavailable. Deterministic risk analysis completed.”

UI Integration

Add the tool to the sidebar navigation

Add a dashboard card with a short description

Follow the same layout and visual style as existing tools

Disclaimer (Mandatory)

Display this disclaimer at the bottom of the tool:

“This analyzer highlights dependency risk patterns and known indicators. It is not a replacement for enterprise vulnerability scanners or continuous security tooling.”

Constraints

Do NOT claim real-time CVE scanning

Do NOT reference proprietary scanners

Do NOT add animations

Keep UI minimal and professional

Outcome

This tool must demonstrate:

Secure-by-design thinking

Supply-chain awareness

Responsible AI usage

Production-grade engineering judgment
