Objective

Improve navigation behavior, mobile usability, and UI consistency across the Backend Systems Intelligence Studio without changing existing layouts, routes, or visual identity.

Changes Required
1️⃣ Sidebar (Left Panel) Auto-Close Behavior
Current Issue

When a user clicks a tool (e.g., Log & Incident Analyzer, About the Engineer), the sidebar stays open.

The user must manually click outside to close it.

Required Behavior

When any sidebar item is clicked (tool pages, About the Engineer, Contact, etc.):

Automatically close the sidebar

Navigate to the selected page

The sidebar should only open when:

The user explicitly clicks the Dashboard / Menu button at the top

Implementation Notes

Treat the sidebar like a drawer

This should apply to:

Desktop

Tablet

Mobile

Do not break routing or cause page reloads

2️⃣ Replace Top Dashboard Toggle Icon
Current

A square / abstract icon is used to open the sidebar

Change Required

Replace it with a classic hamburger menu icon:

☰ (three horizontal lines)

This icon should:

Clearly indicate “menu / options”

Toggle the sidebar open/close

Constraints

Keep placement the same

Do not change button size or header layout

Maintain accessibility (keyboard + screen readers if present)

3️⃣ Fix Skill Interaction on Mobile (About the Engineer Page)
Current Issue

Skill descriptions are shown on hover

Hover does not work on mobile/touch devices

Tapping skills does nothing on phones

Required Behavior

Desktop / Laptop

Keep existing hover behavior

Mobile / Touch Devices

Change interaction to on-click / on-tap

When a skill is tapped:

Show the description in a popover / modal / expandable card

The content must be clearly readable

Tapping outside or a close button should dismiss it

Important

Do not remove hover behavior on desktop

Use responsive detection (pointer type, screen size, or touch support)

Ensure it feels intentional, not hacked

UX Expectations

Smooth transitions (no flicker)

No breaking of existing styles

Consistent behavior across tools

Professional, production-quality UX

Acceptance Criteria

Sidebar closes automatically after navigation

Sidebar opens only via the hamburger menu

Hamburger menu replaces the square icon

Skill descriptions are accessible on mobile via tap

Desktop hover behavior remains unchanged
