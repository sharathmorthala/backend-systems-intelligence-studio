You are continuing development of a public, personal portfolio application owned by an individual engineer.

Application Identity

Application Name:
Backend Systems Intelligence Studio

Replace all existing references to:

“AI Backend Engineering Toolkit”

“AI Backend Toolkit”

With:

Backend Systems Intelligence Studio

This includes:

Sidebar title

Page headers

Metadata

Documentation text

Tagline (Use Consistently)

Display this tagline under the main title:

Production-minded backend intelligence for reliability, APIs, and distributed systems.

Engineer Identity (MANDATORY)

This is a public personal portfolio, not a generic demo.

Add clear attribution on the About the Engineer page:

Name:
Sharath Morthala

Title:
Senior Backend & Platform Engineer

Display this:

Near the top of the About page

As visible text (not hidden)

Professional Links

Add visible icon links (top-right or footer of About page):

GitHub:
https://github.com/sharathmorthala

LinkedIn:
https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharath-morthala-2657a626b

These must:

Open in a new tab

Use standard icons

Be subtle and professional

About Section Text Update

Rewrite the About description to explicitly reference the engineer in third person.

Use this tone:

“Sharath Morthala is a Senior Backend & Platform Engineer focused on distributed systems, reliability engineering, API design, and production-grade AI integration. This studio reflects real-world engineering practices developed through hands-on work with scalable backend systems.”

Avoid:

First-person language

Employer names

Proprietary workflows

Skill Map Personalization

Keep the existing Skill Map UI.

Update hover descriptions to reflect real production usage, for example:

Kafka → “Used to build event-driven backend systems enabling scalable asynchronous workflows.”

Deterministic Fallbacks → “Ensures predictable system behavior when AI or external dependencies fail.”

Do NOT mention:

Company names

Internal tools

Confidential systems

Footer Attribution

Add this footer line on the About page:

“Designed and built by Sharath Morthala”

Keep the existing philosophy line:

“LLMs are used as assistants. Deterministic backend logic remains the source of truth.”

Constraints

Do NOT add new pages

Do NOT change visual theme

Do NOT add animations

Do NOT remove existing tools

Outcome

The application must clearly present:

Who built it

What level of engineering it represents

Why it is credible for senior backend / platform roles

This is a public engineering portfolio, suitable for recruiters and hiring managers.
