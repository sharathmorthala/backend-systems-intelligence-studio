You are building a production-minded AI-assisted backend engineering demo, designed to showcase senior backend and platform engineering skills.

The application must be domain-neutral (no business workflows, no proprietary concepts).

Application Concept

Build an AI-Assisted Log & Incident Analyzer web application.

Functional Requirements

Accept raw application logs and stack traces as input.

Normalize and structure logs on the backend.

Use an LLM (via the Hugging Face Inference API) to:

Group similar errors.

Summarize root causes.

Identify missing context.

Suggest mitigation or investigation steps.

Return structured JSON output (no free-form blobs).

LLM Integration Details

Use the Hugging Face Inference API to call an open model (e.g., LLaMA-2 or equivalent) via REST.

The LLM should be treated as an assistant, not the system of record.

Outputs must be structured, explainable, and validated before returning to the client.

If the LLM fails or rate limits, implement deterministic fallback behavior.

Technical Requirements

Backend-first architecture with clear API boundaries.

Strong input validation, error handling, and logging.

Emphasis on reliability and debuggability.

UI Requirements

Simple, professional UI with sections:

Log Input

Analysis Results

Error Groups

Recommendations

No flashy animations, no gimmicks.

AI Constraints

Avoid hallucinations by using clear prompt constraints and structured return formats.

The LLM response should be validated for schema compliance.

Final Deliverables

Working web app with frontend, backend, and real LLM integration.

Clean README explaining:

Architecture

Design trade-offs

Error handling and reliability strategies

How this could scale in real systems

Notes on LLM Provider

Integrate the Hugging Face Inference API as the LLM backend.

Document in the README how to replace this with a local or paid provider if needed.

UI Expectations

Clean dashboard layout:

Left: Log input form

Center: Structured analysis (JSON segmentation)

Right: LLM insights panel

Use neutral labels like: “Error Group A”, “Probable Cause”, “Suggested Investigation”.
