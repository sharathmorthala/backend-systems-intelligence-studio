You are continuing work on an existing AI Backend Engineering Toolkit web application.

The “About the Engineer” page is already partially implemented.
Your task is to refine, complete, and professionalize this page — not redesign it.

Scope Control (Important)

Do NOT change the overall layout, navigation, or visual style.

Do NOT add new pages.

Do NOT introduce business-domain concepts.

Only enhance clarity, behavior, and correctness.

About the Engineer Page – Refinement Tasks
1. Header Section

Keep the existing structure, but ensure the description text:

Uses concise, senior-level language

Avoids buzzwords

Clearly communicates backend & platform focus

Example tone:

“Senior Backend & Platform Engineer focused on distributed systems, reliability, API design, and production-grade AI integration.”

2. Skill Map – Hover Explanations (Key Requirement)

Each skill tile must support hover or focus interaction that shows:

Where the skill is used

In what context (backend, platform, reliability, AI-assist)

Level of depth (hands-on, production usage)

Do NOT show years or percentages.
Keep explanations factual and neutral.

Example hover copy patterns:

Java
“Used for building large-scale backend services, API layers, and platform components with emphasis on reliability and maintainability.”

Event-Driven Architecture
“Designed and implemented asynchronous workflows using message brokers to decouple services and improve system resilience.”

Deterministic Fallbacks
“Ensures core system behavior remains predictable when AI or external services are unavailable.”

Hover content should appear as:

Tooltip

Popover

Or inline expandable description

3. Skill Group Integrity

Maintain the current groupings:

Backend Core

Platform & Reliability

Data & Messaging

AI-Assisted Engineering

Ensure terminology is consistent across all groups.

4. Attribution Hooks (Prepare for Personalization)

Add non-intrusive placeholders (not final values yet) for:

Engineer name

GitHub URL

LinkedIn URL

These should be:

Easy to update later

Located in either header or footer

Not visually dominant

Example placeholder behavior:

Small icon links

Optional footer attribution

5. Tone & Messaging Rules

Avoid “expert”, “rockstar”, “guru”

Avoid marketing language

Avoid first-person storytelling

The page should read like:

An internal engineering profile in a serious company

6. Accessibility & UX

Hover content must also be accessible via keyboard focus

Text contrast must remain readable in dark mode

No animations beyond subtle transitions

Engineering Philosophy Footer (Already Present – Verify)

Ensure the footer message remains visible:

“LLMs are used as assistants. Deterministic backend logic remains the source of truth.”

This text must not be removed or altered.

Final Outcome

The “About the Engineer” page should:

Clearly explain what the engineer is strong at

Show how those skills manifest in the toolkit

Feel professional, restrained, and senior

Be safe to share publicly and on LinkedIn

Do not overbuild. Precision matters more than volume.
