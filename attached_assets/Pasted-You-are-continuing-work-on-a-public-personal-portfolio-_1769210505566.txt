You are continuing work on a public, personal portfolio web application titled
“AI Backend Engineering Toolkit”.

This application is owned by an individual engineer and is intended to be shared publicly (LinkedIn, GitHub, recruiters).

Identity & Attribution (IMPORTANT – NEW REQUIREMENT)

This application must clearly identify the engineer.

Engineer Identity

Add the following visible identity elements to the “About the Engineer” page:

Name:
Sharath Morthala

Title:
Senior Backend & Platform Engineer

These must appear:

Near the top of the “About the Engineer” page

Clearly readable

Not hidden behind hover or tooltips

Professional Links

Add clearly visible icon links (top-right or footer of About page):

GitHub:
https://github.com/sharathmorthala

LinkedIn:
https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharath-morthala-2657a626b

These links must:

Open in a new tab

Use recognizable icons

Be subtle but discoverable

About Section – Text Update

Update the description text to explicitly reference the engineer in third person.

Example tone (do NOT use first-person):

“Sharath Morthala is a Senior Backend & Platform Engineer focused on distributed systems, reliability engineering, API design, and production-grade AI integration. This toolkit reflects hands-on experience building and operating scalable backend systems.”

Avoid:

Marketing buzzwords

Overclaiming

First-person language (“I”, “my”)

Skill Map – Contextual Personalization

Keep the existing skill map UI exactly as-is.

However, update hover/focus descriptions to reference real-world usage without naming employers.

Example:

Kafka
“Used in production systems to implement event-driven workflows, improve service decoupling, and support scalable asynchronous processing.”

Deterministic Fallbacks
“Designed to ensure core backend behavior remains predictable when AI services or external dependencies are unavailable.”

Do NOT:

Mention company names

Mention internal tools

Mention confidential workflows

Footer Attribution (Additive)

Add a subtle footer line on the About page:

“Designed and built by Sharath Morthala”

Keep the existing philosophy statement:

“LLMs are used as assistants. Deterministic backend logic remains the source of truth.”

Constraints (Do Not Break These)

Do NOT remove any existing tools

Do NOT rename navigation items

Do NOT change visual theme

Do NOT add animations

Do NOT add new pages

Final Outcome

The About page must:

Clearly identify who built this

Explain what kind of engineer this represents

Be safe to share publicly

Look credible to senior engineers, hiring managers, and recruiters

This is a personal engineering portfolio, not a generic demo.
